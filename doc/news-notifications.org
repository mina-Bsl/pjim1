* News

The news system is a means of propagating messages to the users of a vidjil server installation.
Messages are propagated in near-realtime for users interacting directly with the server and at a slightly slower rate for users simply using the browser but for which the server is configured.

** Message Retrieval
The browser by default periodically queries the server to retrieve any new messages and are displayed on a per user basis. This means that any message having already been viewed by the user is not displayed in the browser.
Older messages can be viewed from the index of news items.
    
** Caching
News items are kept in cache in order to relieve the database from a potentially large amount of queries.
The cache is stored for each user and is updated only when a change occurs (message read, message created or message edited).
    
** Formatting
   Messages can be formatted by using the Markdown syntax. Syntax details are
