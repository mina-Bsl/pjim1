* Database schema

** Patients and samples

A patient has several samples. A sample is an uploaded .fasta/.fastq file.

** Launching and results

A software/pipeline (as for example Vidjil or Brno pipeline) 
process .fasta/.fastq file and produce a "data file".
The options of the software/pipeline are stored in a "config". 

** "Fusing" results on different samples

The result "data files" of a same patient (and processed within a same "config") 
are "fused" to a unique "fused file". 


** Analysis

All changes done by the user (on a specific "fused file") are recorded
into a ".analysis" file and stored into the database.


** Authentification

There is a mecanism to authenticate users/groups and to grant them some accesses on the patients:
  - read 
  - add samples (to an existing patient, uploading .fasta/.fastq files)
  - add patients
  - save an analysis (with some clones merged, labeled or renamed)
  - delete samples and patients
